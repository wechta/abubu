Google sitemaps for TYPO3
======================

This is a "dd_googlesitemap" TYPO3 extension. You will need a TYPO3 CMS to run it.

What does it do?
----------------
This extension adds sitemaps for pages and tt_news items. Typically you add the result to Google like http://example.com/index.php?eID=dd_googlesitemap.

Make sure to read the manual in the doc/ directory before asking questions or writing bug reports. Anything, which is explained in the manual, will be silently closed without answering.

What it does not do?
--------------------
Many things. It is deliberately not a "all-purpose solution". It is created to be fast and efficient. It only contains sitemaps for pages and tt_news and there are no plans to change that or do any sophisticated filtering, etc. You still can ask though :)
