/**
 * This is the "pluripotent stem cell" of div2007.
 *
 * <b>MOST CENTRAL OBJECT</b>
 *
 * This object is the common parent of almoust all objects used in div2007 development. It provides
 * functionality and an API that all lib/div objects have in common. By knowing this object you know
 * 90% of all objects.
 *
 * This class implements the powerfull PHP5 interfaces <b>ArrayAccess</b> and <b>Iterator</b> and
 * also backports them for PHP4. This is done by implementing the central SPL classes <b>ArrayObject</b>
 * and <b>ArrayIterator</b> in form of plain PHP code.
 *
 * <a href="http://de2.php.net/manual/en/ref.spl.php">See Standard PHP Library</a>
 *
 * <b>ArrayAccess</b>
 *
 * Access the values of an object by keys like an array.
 *
 *   $value = $this->parameters['exampleKey']
 * or
 *   $value = $this->parameters->get('exampleKey');
 *
 * <b>Iterator</b>
 *
 * Iterate over the values of an object just like an array.
 *
 *   foreach($this->parameters as $key => $value) { ... }
 * or:
 *   for($this->parameters->rewind(), $this->parameters->valid(), $this->parameters->next()) {
 *      $key = $this->parameters->key();
 *      $value = $this->parameters->current();
 *   }
 *
 * <b>The request cycle as a chain of SPL objects</b>
 *
 * A central feature of SPL objects is the possiblity to feed one SPL object into the constructor of the next.
 * By this list of values can be processed by a chain of SPL objects alwasys using the same simple API.
 * It is suggested to implement the different stations of the request cycle from request to response in form
 * of SPL objects.
 *
 * The class provides a lot of addiotional functions to make setting and getting still more comfortables.
 * Functions to store the data into the session are also provided.
 *
 *
 * Depends on: tx_div2007_objectBase
 * Used by: All object within this framework by direct or indirect inheritance.
